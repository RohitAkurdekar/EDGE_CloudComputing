<h2>Smoke Testing</h2>

Smoke Testing comes into the picture at the time of receiving build software from the development team. The purpose of smoke testing is to determine whether the build software is testable or not. It is done at the time of "building software." This process is also known as "Day 0".

In the smoke testing, we only focus on the positive flow of the application and enter only valid data, not the invalid data. In smoke testing, we verify every build is testable or not; hence it is also known as Build Verification Testing.
